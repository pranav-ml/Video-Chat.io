Once you have Node.js and React.js installed on your computer,

#### Clone or download this repository.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/pranav-ml/Video-Chat.io.git
```

#### Change the folder and Install dependencies.
```sh
cd .\Video-Chat.io\client
npm install
```
#### Run the project.
```sh
npm start

The application will start running on `localhost:3000` which will open automatically on your default browser.
Open up multiple tabs of `localhost:3000` to create multiple client instances. Rest of the app is fairly intuitive.
